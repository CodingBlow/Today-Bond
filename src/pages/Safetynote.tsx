          Safety Guidelines for Using Today Bond Adhesive
        </h2>
        <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">General Precautions</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Ensure Proper Ventilation:</strong> Always work in a
            well-ventilated space to minimize inhaling fumes from the adhesive.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Keep Out of Reach of Children and Pets:</strong> Store all
            chemical products securely, away from children and pets to prevent
            accidental exposure.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cap It When Not in Use:</strong> Keep the glue container
            tightly sealed when not in use. This prevents spillage if the bottle
            tips over.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Handle with Care:</strong> Today Bond can adhere to skin and
            eyes almost instantly. In case of accidental bonding, donâ€™t panic!
            Today Bond can be safely dissolved using acetone.
          </p>

            Using Acetone for Adhesive Removal
          </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Acetone Availability:</strong> Acetone is commonly found in
            nail polish removers. Check the label to confirm it contains
            acetone, as some newer products omit it due to its impact on acrylic
            nails.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Application Tips:</strong> Apply acetone sparingly using a
            cotton swab or Q-tip directly on the affected area. This will
            dissolve the adhesive bond. Avoid pulling the skin apart to prevent
            injury; instead, gently peel or roll the skin apart as you would
            remove a bandage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Caution on Surfaces:</strong> Be aware that acetone can
            damage certain materials, such as dark-colored countertops, fabrics,
            or laminated surfaces. It may also dry out the skin, so wash
            thoroughly with soap and water after use, and apply lotion to
            restore moisture.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">Specific Situations</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Clothing/Fabrics:</strong> Use acetone with an old
            toothbrush to work on the glue. Brush layer by layer, applying
            acetone as needed from both the outside and inside of the fabric.
            Note that complete removal might not always be possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Counters, Tables, Floors, etc.:</strong> Apply acetone to
            soften the glue, then scrape, peel, brush, sand, or shave the
            adhesive off using mechanical means. Reapply acetone as needed to
            loosen stubborn residues. To avoid these situations, protect your
            workspace with a metal foil or similar barrier before using
            adhesives.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-4">Adhesive on Body Parts</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Skin:</strong> Immerse the affected area in warm, soapy
            water. Gently peel or roll the skin apart using a utensil like a
            teaspoon handle, spatula, or pencil. If needed, apply acetone-based
            nail polish remover to dissolve the cured adhesive. Wash with soap
            and water afterward.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Lips:</strong> If lips become bonded, saturate them with
            warm water and encourage wetting with saliva from inside the mouth.
            Slowly peel or roll (do not pull) the lips apart. Swallowing liquid
            Today Bond is highly unlikely as it solidifies on contact with
            saliva. The dried adhesive will naturally detach in 1-2 days. Avoid
            swallowing the loosened adhesive pieces.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Eyelids:</strong> If eyelids become glued together or
            adhered to the eyeball, rinse with warm water and cover with a gauze
            patch. The eyelids will typically separate naturally within 1-4
            days. Avoid attempting to force them open. No cases of permanent eye
            damage from adhesive exposure have been documented.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Eyeball:</strong> In the event adhesive contacts the
            eyeball, it will bind to the eye protein but will naturally
            disassociate over time, often within a few hours. Double vision or
            weeping may occur until the adhesive clears. Frequent rinsing with
            water can help speed up the process.
          </p>

            Important Recommendation
          </h3>
          <p>
            For any adhesive exposure involving the eyes, we strongly recommend
            consulting a physician immediately to ensure safety and proper care.
